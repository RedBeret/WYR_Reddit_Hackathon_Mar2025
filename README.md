# Would You Rather Game

An interactive "Would You Rather" game built with Devvit for the Hack Reddit hackathon in March 2025. This project lets Reddit users participate in fun and dynamic polls within their communities.

## Overview

This application presents two options in a "Would You Rather" format, encouraging discussion and participation within Reddit communities. The game rotates its question every hour, ensuring fresh content throughout the month.

## Features

- **Daily Question Rotation:** Displays a new question every day from a predefined list.
- **User Voting:** Users can vote on their preferred option and see real-time results.
